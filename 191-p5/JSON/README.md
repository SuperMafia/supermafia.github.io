# Trying my hands on JSON Files

To say the least, it was an interesting, but not super frustrating challenge. By the way, I do have two influences on whom I would like to possibly try to make myself:
[Here's what I would like to do, if we ever get far enough into js to replicate the effects. The artist is MrDraklin and he created four Steven Universe gifs based around the Diamond Authority.](https://mrdraklin.tumblr.com/post/149541063793/the-four-diamonds-of-steven-universe-re-edited)
[My second influence, if I wanted to go into doing a small video game, has to be from the Shantae series and its creators WayForward.](https://wayforward.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Screen-Shot-03.png)
As of right now, though, the file fails because of an error regarding XML and the url I've provided for it. I'm not too sure what to do with it, actually. Here's the errors straight from the console:
