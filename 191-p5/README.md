# Final Project Proposition

For my final project, I would like to make a simple video game. While I lack the proficiency in video game coding or other portions that I would deem necessary for such a task, I will need to look at the [p5.play site] (http://p5play.molleindustria.org/) and potentially download it in order to utilize p5.js' elements into it. At the most complex, I would like to attempt a walk cycle coding, jump coding, simple movement coding, and death areas with multi-pixel sprites on a background. At the most simple, I'm just gonna do a Flappy Bird clone. If I were to do the complex way, I would like to utilize the sprites from [Shantae game for GBC] (https://www.spriters-resource.com/game_boy_gbc/shantae/sheet/13500/), though the simplest one I would utilize the [Pirahnna Plant and Pipes from Super Mario Bros 3] (https://www.spriters-resource.com/nes/supermariobros3/). Finally, I would like some pointers as to where I can go find useful areas where I can learn simple game coding for the p5 family.
