# Final Project Proposition

For my final project, I would like to make a simple video game. While I lack the proficiency in video game coding or other portions that I would deem necessary for such a task, I will need to look at the [p5.play site] (http://p5play.molleindustria.org/) and potentially download it in order to utilize p5.js' elements into it. At the most complex, I would like to attempt a walk cycle coding, jump coding, simple movement coding, and death areas with multi-pixel sprites on a background. At the most simple, I'm just gonna do a Flappy Bird clone. If I were to do the complex way, I would like to utilize the sprites from [Shantae game for GBC] (https://www.spriters-resource.com/game_boy_gbc/shantae/sheet/13500/), though the simplest one I would utilize the [Pirahnna Plant and Pipes from Super Mario Bros 3] (https://www.spriters-resource.com/nes/supermariobros3/). Finally, I would like some pointers as to where I can go find useful areas where I can learn simple game coding for the p5 family.

Sub Problems:
The primary problem, for me, is that I have no real idea how to utilize p5 to work in Gaming, so I would need to learn the basics for that type of coding. In addition, I usually fail when it comes to doing simpler tasks that others are able to do with horrifyingly good precision. Mostly, though, it's just animating the sprites of whatever I choose and how to link them to specific areas (in air, use a jump animation that'll stay on the final frames unless it lands, then use a landing animation. When moving, utilize a walk cycle, otherwise idle, etc.)

Work Schedule:
11/14: Download the p5.play Library and learn the basics of it.
11/16: Attempt to link WASD to directional inputs. Also learn gravity.
11/21: Get some ground up, so the character won't fall to infinity.
Before 12/1: Get a comfortable walk cycle up and at 'em. Maybe a jump animation, too.
12/5: Replace the ground with actual ground, possibly set up a background.
Before 12/12: Get the final project ready.
