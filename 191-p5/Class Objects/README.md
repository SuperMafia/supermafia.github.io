# A classroom of Steven Universe references.

Thanks to the help I've recieved on Monday, the entire class of Pink Diamonds can move back and forth and throughout the entire canvas. First as a singular Pink Diamond, shattered upwards, then outwards in a big bang. By the way, sorry Steven Universe fans, spoilers. Until I can somehow enable a scale onto this piece once it strikes the Height and Width boundaries without making them disappear, it'll just be identical sized Pink Diamond chunks bouncing all over the place. Might add in tears later for a seperate class project.
